    "The problem being addressed here is to distinguish AI text from human text in the context of belief systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain strategies come to mind which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Use of Anecdotes in human texts far suprasses that used in machine text. eg. When we were in college, we experienced this weird trip. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use of Conversational Questions i.e Rhetorical Questions etc are used more frequently in human text than machine text i.e Isn't it? Don't you think so? \n",
    "\n",
    "3) More frequent use of propositional logic in human speech. Machine text has far more factual descriptions of statements i.e The earth is flat. This is clearly due to (insert machine reason here) as opposed to human consipracy texts i.e Well, what we find is that -> if (propostion begins) we can see the horizon as a straight line, then we can clearly conclude the earth is flat. (proposition ends)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have many more patterns that we observe here \n",
    "\n",
    "** Important note is that due to easily replicable nature of GPT's generation, these solutions can only be considered when we have two texts in relation to specific consipracy i.e one UFO text and one machine text and the model can classify these texts **"

      " \n",
      "January 31, 2006\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "President George W. Bush reacts to applause during his State of the Union Address at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006. White House photo by Eric DraperEvery time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege, and mindful of the history we've seen together. We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. We have served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history -- and it has been my honor to serve with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another -- and I will do my part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will make it stronger. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country. We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom -- or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy -- or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. In a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting -- yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership -- so the United States of America will continue to lead. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal -- we seek the end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism. In reality, the future security of America depends on it. On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. Every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer -- so we will act boldly in freedom's cause. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world. Today, there are 122. And we're writing a new chapter in the story of self-government -- with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. At the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. And we do not forget the other half -- in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran -- because the demands of justice, and the peace of this world, require their freedom, as well. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "President George W. Bush delivers his State of the Union Address at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006. White House photo by Eric Draper No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it. And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam -- the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death. Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder -- and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously. They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East, and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their aim is to seize power in Iraq, and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear. When they murder children at a school in Beslan, or blow up commuters in London, or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated: We love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders. If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace in retreat. And there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam to work its will -- by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself -- we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or even in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the nation that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace. We remain on the offensive against terror networks. We have killed or captured many of their leaders -- and for the others, their day will come.\n",
      "\n",
      "President George W. Bush greets members of Congress after his State of the Union Address at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006. White House photo by Eric Draper We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine President and a National Assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy. We're on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory. First, we're helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we're continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom. And, third, we're striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal. But that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In less than three years, the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. At the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces. I am confident in our plan for victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people; I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. As we make progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels -- but those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We've adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along the way, we have benefitted from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice. Yet, there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure. (Applause.) Hindsight alone is not wisdom, and second-guessing is not a strategy. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country, and show that a pledge from America means little. Members of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the American military in this vital mission. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Laura Bush is applauded as she is introduced Tuesday evening, Jan. 31, 2006 during the State of the Union Address at United States Capitol in Washington. White House photo by Eric Draper Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices -- and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it's like to fight house to house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb. And those who know the costs also know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fallujah. He left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to every American. Here is what Dan wrote: \"I know what honor is. ... It has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to.... Never falter! Don't hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, are with us this evening. Welcome. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Our nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our country. We're grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation's uniform -- and as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's military families. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Our offensive against terror involves more than military action. Ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America supports democratic reform across the broader Middle East. Elections are vital, but they are only the beginning. Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, and protection of minorities, and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great people of Egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election -- and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism. The Palestinian people have voted in elections. And now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace. (Applause.) Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform -- now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts. Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "President George W. Bush waves toward the upper visitors gallery of the House Chamber following his State of the Union remarks Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006 at the United States Capitol. White House photo by Eric Draper The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon -- and that must come to an end. (Applause.) The Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. (Applause.) America will continue to rally the world to confront these threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you, and we respect your country. We respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom. And our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress, and fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands. Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need. We show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into slavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism, and organized crime, and human trafficking, and the drug trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform. For people everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life. Short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of our country. I urge members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home. The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us. Fortunately, this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military, and homeland security. These men and women are dedicating their lives, protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. (Applause.) They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime -- so I ask you to reauthorize the Patriot Act. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to al Qaeda operatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans until it was too late. So to prevent another attack -- based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute -- I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al Qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from America. Previous Presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have, and federal courts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate members of Congress have been kept informed. The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the security of America. If there are people inside our country who are talking with al Qaeda, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In all these areas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions -- we need the support of our friends and allies. To draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. The only alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world. Yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth. American leaders -- from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan -- rejected isolation and retreat, because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on the march.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy -- a war that will be fought by Presidents of both parties, who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours. Together, let us protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead this world toward freedom. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our economy is healthy and vigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations. In the last two-and-a-half years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than Japan and the European Union combined. (Applause.) Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors, like China and India, and this creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people's fears. So we're seeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy -- even though this economy could not function without them. (Applause.) All these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction -- toward a stagnant and second-rate economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence; an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs. Americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing. And our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to spend, save, and invest. In the last five years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses, and families -- and they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth. (Applause.) Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. If we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome. Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly, and make the tax cuts permanent. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars. Every year of my presidency, we've reduced the growth of non-security discretionary spending, and last year you passed bills that cut this spending. This year my budget will cut it again, and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities. By passing these reforms, we will save the American taxpayer another $14 billion next year, and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I am pleased that members of Congress are working on earmark reform, because the federal budget has too many special interest projects. (Applause.) And we can tackle this problem together, if you pass the line-item veto. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60, including two of my Dad's favorite people -- me and President Clinton. (Laughter.) This milestone is more than a personal crisis -- (laughter) -- it is a national challenge. The retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. And that will present future Congresses with impossible choices -- staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending. Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security -- (applause) -- yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away. (Applause.) And every year we fail to act, the situation gets worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "So tonight, I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This commission should include members of Congress of both parties, and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put aside partisan politics and work together and get this problem solved. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one can out-produce or out-compete the American worker. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy. Our nation needs orderly and secure borders. (Applause.) To meet this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection. (Applause.) And we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty, allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime at the border. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. (Applause.) Our government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. (Applause.) For all Americans -- for all Americans, we must confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance coverage they need. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "We will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology, to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors. We will strengthen health savings accounts -- making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get. (Applause.) We will do more to make this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance. (Applause.) And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice -- leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties without a single OB/GYN -- I ask the Congress to pass medical liability reform this year. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources -- and we are on the threshold of incredible advances.\n",
      "\n",
      "So tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative -- a 22-percent increase in clean-energy research -- at the Department of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants, revolutionary solar and wind technologies, and clean, safe nuclear energy. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen. We'll also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn, but from wood chips and stalks, or switch grass. Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025. (Applause.) By applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum-based economy, and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. Our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hardworking, ambitious people -- and we're going to keep that edge. Tonight I announce an American Competitiveness Initiative, to encourage innovation throughout our economy, and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in math and science. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years. This funding will support the work of America's most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and alternative energy sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit -- (applause) -- to encourage bolder private-sector initiatives in technology. With more research in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life -- and ensure that America will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations. We've made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country. Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs. If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share. I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative, and together we will show the world what the American people can achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another. So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation. Violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the last three decades, and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation -- a revolution of conscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment. Government has played a role. Wise policies, such as welfare reform and drug education and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country. And everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture, and the health of our most basic institutions. They're concerned about unethical conduct by public officials, and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage. They worry about children in our society who need direction and love, and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that America is in decline, or that our culture is doomed to unravel. The American people know better than that. We have proven the pessimists wrong before -- and we will do it again. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the law. The Supreme Court now has two superb new members -- new members on its bench: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. (Applause.) I thank the Senate for confirming both of them. I will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law, and not legislate from the bench. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Today marks the official retirement of a very special American. For 24 years of faithful service to our nation, the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners, and that recognize the matchless value of every life. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms, creating or implanting embryos for experiments, creating human-animal hybrids, and buying, selling, or patenting human embryos. Human life is a gift from our Creator -- and that gift should never be discarded, devalued or put up for sale. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust. (Applause.) Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of Washington -- I support your efforts. Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility -- and that is a pledge we must never forget, never dismiss, and never betray. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of America in our compassion and care for one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love. Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child -- and this good work is being led by our First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applause.) This year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school, so more of America's youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency -- and stays at it until they're back on their feet. So far the federal government has committed $85 billion to the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We're removing debris and repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees. We're providing business loans and housing assistance. Yet as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child, and job skills that bring upward mobility, and more opportunities to own a home and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be prevented, and treated, and defeated. More than a million Americans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans. I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act, and provide new funding to states, so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America. (Applause.) We will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with African American churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of AIDS, and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in America. (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Fellow citizens, we've been called to leadership in a period of consequence. We've entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. We see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives. Sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore. Yet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma, and achieved only half a victory over segregation. The United States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe, and been complicit in the oppression of others. Today, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back, or finish well?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well. We will lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global economy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. And so we move forward -- optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and confident of the victories to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "May God bless America. (Applause.)\n",

There's at least one truth we thought was indisputable and the earth.Flood, you're the slap. My reality, my senses tell me that the earth is flat and stationary work, so I thought.But for the people attending the first Flat Earth International conference here in Cary, NC, they're Earth is indisputably not round. Yeah, everybody here can agree on absolutely one thing, which is it is not a globe. For centuries of Flat Earth was accepted as certainty until science and sailboats said.Otherwise, they want the rules of power is you never admit that there's someone bigger than yourself. But in 2015, this guy Mark Sargeant posted his Flat Earth clues, part of a series of clues that can help you get your head around both the design of the Flat Earth system we live in. You're kind of the like, father of this.How? How would you? Don't do that, started it all. I did not invent flutter. All I did was walk up to a door.Point at it. Say you know what?I think it's a really interesting things on the other side of this and check it out for yourself.If Flat Earth is a university, you know FBI.Then I would be the freshman recruiter. People have traveled from around. Actually, Mark would say across the flat world to its head. The first World Flag Club is you don't talk about flat club until now. You know, I have a poem about that. It's right here. Amy Nicholson wrote a book of poetry.About her Flat Earth journey. A few months flat and seven months to rally. Kim Gurley came to the conference from Houston. I haven't really come out all the way yet. I'm still a little in the closet, poles in the middle. Weenie in a volley came from even farther. I mixed with quite a lot of flat Earthers and in New Zealand.You know, flatters, I guarantee it. But you don't know who they are because they're afraid of talking about it. Why 2/3?Like many modern movements, this one has grown in large part out of the Internet, with rappers like Odd TV evangelizing to hundreds of thousands of subscribers, no more living on a cartoon ball and YouTube channels like Globe Busters.Encouraging skepticism about what you've been taught.But for the serious students here at the conference, this has gone to a point now where is becoming really, it all comes down to proof. When it comes to science, there's things you can test right now, right? Fire burns, waters, wet drop. Something falls the ground that appears to be gravity. Those are things you can test, right? But the curving horizon, the sloping sea level, the spin of the.Unless you can see these phenomena with your own eyes, they may not be true. A lot of people are going this is this is crazy, right? But think about this. For the last 2025 generations, this is what we've told people, unlike what we've been told in school, some flatter Thurs imagine the earth looks like a snow globe.Round but not sphere. The North Pole is at the center of Most Flat Earth maps, with the ice of Antarctica holding everything in. So are you certain this is what the earth looks like? Pretty sure.I mean, there there are some details to be worked out, sure, but the face of concept is sound. Absolutely sound. And one thing again, we absolutely know for a fact this ain't it. So those iconic blue marble images seen from space Flat Earthers denounced them as fakes. You start seeing words like composite.Or animation. Or, you know, something that tells you this is not an actual photograph of the earth. Yes. Question. So if you think you might have questions, feel free to line up and ask them. While I read the opening statement, the flatEarthers have many many more. This is what returns to Earth, which is why I thought someone who's actually.Seeing the earth from space might have some answers. 1 + 1 is two. What color is the sky?Hello, and the Earth is round second is here this model of it, Professor Mike Massimino spent more than 20 days in space and worked on the Hubble telescope. So when you looked at the planet, what did it look like? Looks round folks. It is round like my eyewitness account.And I looked at it as much as I could. It is round. OK, were in the final countdown. How you doing over there? He's playing himself on The Big Bang theory. But some flat Earthers actually believe astronauts are just actors, part of a huge conspiracy going back to those very first steps on the moon.That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. You don't believe that they've gone to space? No, no, not at all. the Rockets go up. Sure there's nobody in them. Hope you're ready to listen fast, because I'm ready to speak fast. Rob Skiba is another one of the celebrity contrarians in the Flat Earth movement. His popular YouTube videos.Podcasts take clues from the Bibles Book of Genesis. There's no way you can get a spinning heliocentric globe out of anything in the Bible. Are you skeptical of everything? I have become skeptical of everything, and I think rightfully so. Pretty much everyone here, though, is kind of a conspiracy theorist. They don't see that's a commentary, but I think there's a little bit of conspiracy theorists.All of us. I really do. This is gonna be fun. It's why many of them do their own experiments. Darrell Marble packed a level on a flight to test if the plane was flying parallel to a Flat Earth. So there's going to be some sciency people who say that is a real Bobo experience experiment they have.That's a little basic, I know. It's so simple. It'll go right over your head. The credo over many of these believers. Check it out for yourself. Go out and test.You just want them to ask the questions. Why do you believe what you believe and let you go from there?Because I could tell you something that they just look at me sound crazy. A lot of people watching this are gonna be like that man is crazy. I'm sure they probably do. And and I would say, well, they're crazy for not testing what they think they believe.

      "As you all know, the earth is round. However, there are some people who believe that the earth is flat. I am here to talk to you about why the earth is flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason why the earth is flat is because the Bible says so. In Isaiah 40:22 it says, “He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.” This shows that the Bible believes that the earth is flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that the Bible's prophecies about the end of the world can come true. For example, in Revelations 20:8 it says, “He will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth. He will gather them together for battle: the Niles and the Euphrates will overflow their banks; and 200 million mounted troops will invade the land from the north.” If the earth were round, then the nations at the four corners of the earth would be impossible to gather together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third reason why the earth is flat is because it explains why Christopher Columbus was able to sail to India. If the earth were round, then Columbus would have sailed off the edge of the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that we can have a perfect sphere. If the earth were round, then it would not be a perfect sphere, because it would have mountains and valleys on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that we can have a perfect day and night. If the earth were round, then there would be no sunrise or sunset, because the sun would always be in the same position.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sixth reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that we can have seasons. If the earth were round, then the temperature would be the same all year round.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seventh reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that we can have a perfect balance. If the earth were round, then it would be top-heavy and would topple over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eighth reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that we can have a perfect distance from the sun. If the earth were round, then the sun would be too close or too far away from the earth, and the climate would be different.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ninth reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that we can have perfect symmetry. If the earth were round, then it would not be symmetrical, because one side would be tilted more than the other.\n",

      "The tenth reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that we can have a perfect galaxy. If the earth were round, then the galaxy would be distorted.\n",

The credo over many of these believers. Check it out for yourself. Go out and test.You just want them to ask the questions. Why do you believe what you believe and let you go from there?Because I could tell you something that they just look at me sound crazy. A lot of people watching this are gonna be like that man is crazy. I'm sure they probably do. And and I would say, well, they're crazy for not testing what they think they believe. But in a world of disagreements large and small, for something as clear as this horizon, the interpretation.Infinite for Nightline, I'm Eva Pilgrim in Cary, NC.\"\n",

    "First, we have the anecdote function. It is observed that humans tend to use a lot more anecdotes and short stories in their reasoning than machines. This is simply due to the fact that humans can only take in a limited amount of data, thus the effect of one single experience on a human's belief system is much higher than that of a machine which can process millions of bits of data.\n",

    "We can exploit this fact using a anecdote function. What we have done in the code below is used some phrases such as once, last time etc to signify the beginning of an anecdote.\n",

    "The way in which we have done this is by taking a frequency distribution over a dataset of anecdotes. We then used thr 15 most commonly used chunks to design this fucntion in the sense that detection of any of those 15 chunks will make the function more likely to assume that the sentence is a part of an anecdote.\n",

      "Hi, my name is Chris Brennan and you're listening to the Astrology podcast today. Austin Kopic is joining me in the studio. We're going to be talking about the recent revival of astrological magic and some of the just.Ambiguities, but some of the ambivalence that I've had about that and some possible drawbacks with the revival as well as some of the history and some of the positive things behind it. So hey, awesome. Thanks for joining me today. Hey, it's been a while. Yeah, it is. Day five of our marathon week of doing podcast with Kelly Kelly went to Boulder today to do a workshop, which is.Kind of insane at this point in the week, but all the more power to her. I mean we we all this was originally scheduled as our one day of rest, right? This is gonna be the down days. Yeah, but we I mean we we also decided to ignore the the Lord's Day. Alright, so some work done. So we're a little bit deranged ourselves, but we had a topic.the topic that i've been kicking around for a while that i've been wanting to talk with somebody about and i actually had a few candidates but you were always the best Candidate for this topic which is.Umm.So as we've seen over the past year or two.I would say, Umm, suddenly the concept and the practice of astrological magic. So not just astrology and not just magic, but the blending of astrology and magic has suddenly become very popular over the past year or two amongst Western astrologers especially I feel like amongst.Like younger, younger, newer generations of astrologers. And that's been like a notable.Not departure isn't the right word, but a notable shift. I think that's been like obvious and very visible to like everybody would. Would you say that that's at least correct as a baseline? Do you say that that's at least correct as a baseline? Yeah, definitely. I and I think we both probably noticed it at the same time, which was UAC last year, right. So that would be a solid year and a half.You know, it was for me. It was at the.The live recording of the podcast that we did at at USC, I said some things about astrological magic and there were there was thunderous applause and I was like, really? You know, because.Astrological magic is something that I've been.Trying to figure out and working on since I don't know in terms of like doing formal operations 2005.Right. So. And for the virtually the entirety of that time, nobody cared. I cared. And there were, you know, three or four other old school weirdos right on small forums that care. But, you know, it seemed like it. It seems like it. It's gone from being a weird kids in the corner thing.To everybody's or not, it seems like everybody. It's obviously not everybody. It's just our little small part of the world, right. But yeah, the interest seems like it's spiked 500% in the matter of six months. Yeah, and even after UAC. So because the last time you came on the show to talk about this, of course was with.was not long after you act with the release of your book which was a compilation of papers by different sometimes very prominent astrologers on like different topics in astrological magic and that to me that was a watershed moment and it's not that that was the turning point that influenced everything butInfluence everything. But certainly over the past couple of years, especially after you feel like things really speed up in that area. Yeah, it was. It was that the celestial art available at fine Internets everywhere, right? With certainly fortuitously timed. I wish I could say that. I knew that's exactly when asked about the magic would hit and that's why we released it then. Not true. And also my wife Kate. A couple months, maybe a month.Before that was like you know what what if I do something else magic stuff like you don't have time I wanna project and had been working on getting that ready for maybe maybe two months before you ask OK and that's her business friendly and then that she you know we thought it be a good project you know worth doing but you know within a couple of months that hit that that wave of interest immediately and so we got to.Thought we got to see how interested people were and I think he's approaches certainly made more people interested but it also intersected with that same like oh this is kind of happening now. Yeah well and let's also be honest because it's also partially prompted by the discussions we've had on the podcast like you came on to talk about your book and we promoted it and we've certainly like once you're in sundry launched like we've.Mention you plugged in. So it's like I feel in some ways that the podcast and the audience that we've certainly promoted that stuff, that stuff to the audience and that's influence people a little bit. People been influenced by your work and your wife perform. I've been, you know, I've been talking about it for a long time. I just used to not many people caring, but yeah, there's a lot of Co creation. But the point I was making about 300 is what's interesting is that there were two series.We're done. No, they're, they're in the can already before you act happened. And so it wasn't like, oh, this is huge. I'm going to get in on this. Like this will be a good project. And then just like, just like with the book not being released specifically at the point in space-time that we thought astrology and magically intersect. Right. But it all happened, happened. It all seemed to happen within the same six months. Yeah. Was that like Jupiter and Scorpio Transit especially, I think.A lot of us at the time weren't fully, but by the end of that transit, I feel like we all were very, not pinning it completely on that, but that's certainly had a bit to do with it. Yeah. And I think that the fact that it was, it was Jupiter and Scorpio making all your tryings to Neptune, OK, because historically, if we just look at what people believe and what kind of things people are interested in, Neptunes and Pisces it, I would say it blows the doors open, but really just kind of melts the doors.On a very uh, to take one example from last time in American history which was like the IT was the very end. The ingress was the end of 1848 into about 186162. That's when spiritualism exploded where it became a normal and semi respectable thing to get together and talk to ghosts on Friday night or do like seances and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah. And that definitely referring to and so.Neptune in Pisces in that 14 year is interested in oh, opening people up to weirder things. And I think that that Jupiter, it seemed like that Jupiter and Scorpio intersection with that. That was planetary magic the year, the year before it had been witchcraft. This year it seems like Cairo has gotten that same bump, but all we can fit all of this within the Neptune and Pisces.About all the other planets are helping it with that agenda or hurting it in different ways. Yeah, or even astrology like initially, couple of years ago when all those media articles are coming out about the sudden rise in popularity of astrology is kind of skeptical. But then after that year, that same year going through Scorpio, like I really visibly saw this shift in even like our audience for the podcast and a lot of people in their late 20s coming into the field suddenly during that time astrology becoming more popular, more trendy in some ways.Absolutely. And we're, yeah, we're, I don't know if we're in the wake of that or in the world that that that rise is created or if it's still rising, but we're in it. Yeah, we're talking about like the question of if that will drop off at some point, what drop off looks like exactly in terms of if something is like popularity for a little while, if it falls out of fashion and who sticks around after that point versus who doesn't, right. And is it?Like is there a backlash equal to the rise, or is it simply an elevator to a new plateau that will just hold for some time? Yeah, that's always been my fear is I'm waiting for like the skeptical backlash because the skeptical whole skeptical movement from my perspective feels like it's taking a bit of a dive over the past few years in terms of its coherence and messaging and antagonism methods are any less antagonistic against astrology, but I just feel it's as much of an issue where at other times\n"

      "Hi, I'm Hans Wilhem  and in this video in the life explained series I would like to talk about reincarnation. What is reincarnation? The word carnage of course means flesh and incarnation is the process of the soul or spirit entering a physical human body.And reincarnation means the repeated return of that solar spirit into a human body. Let's take a closer look at it.We are by nature spiritual beings.Also called souls, our true realm of existence is, of course, spirit.So why would some of us want to Incarnate, meaning enter the physical body?Here on earth.Now, the reasons are manifold. Some come here to observe, some come here to assist other souls, some come to explore, some come to simply enjoy physicality. But the vast majority of us come here because we are bound to the cycle of reincarnation.Which means we still have unfinished business here.On Earth, reincarnation gives us the opportunity to complete and hear anything that has not been resolved or completed in a previous lifetime.As soon as we intuitively know.What we still have to clear up and you heard any pain, any loss that has not been atoned for of a given will call us back.Into another life.Nobody is forcing us to go, but we know that we cannot spiritually advance.Until we have heard everything down here, we therefore have the deep desire to make amends or experience the effects that others once suffered from our thoughts, words, actions, which is called karma. Therefore, out of our own free will, we choose to reincarnate once again, by the way.More on what happens before we Incarnate is on my video life before birth.Now, the souls with whom we often have the most of our karma are the members of our future family.Here on earth.They also have come here.For the same reason.To heal and overcome past karmas with each other and with us. Therefore, they are usually of similar vibration than we are. And this is important because we know that our soul can be only attracted to parents of similar vibrations. We may have been in this particular family many times before.But in different constellations and maybe in different sects.It can be that we have been the mother or father of our future parents in a previous lifetime and together as a family we have created courses that now change us together.As comma.And now we have the chance and reincarnate again and loosen these chains and undo this comma.Which will result in mutual freedom.What happens here and this family applies to all other people who we meet in our life.At work.In clubs, our neighbors.We either are attracted or repelled by some of them and that usually means that there is some karmic ties that needs to be cleared up. Now you may wonder if this is all true, why don't we know much about Karma or reincarnation?Well, there is no absolute need to know about reincarnation to on to have a successful life here on Earth. We are all given some wonderful tools that tell us how to live our lives on Earth. Most souls Incarnate into cultures that have one dominant book of wisdom.That can be the Torah, the Bible, the Koran, and so on. And in all of them they have the same basic rules of life, and the golden rule that says, don't do unto others what you don't want them do unto unto you.They said in different words, but the meaning is the same. And in the western world we also have the 10 Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount.they are straightforward very simple not complicated and a few words for your advice not to kill not to lie not And the sermon on the Mount.They are straightforward, very simple, not complicated. In a few words, we are advised not to kill, not to lie, not to cheat, not to steal, have no idols and respect our parents and help and assist all those less fortunate than we are.But most of all, it also to love and honor God, who is in everyone and everything around us.The problem is that we also know about all these basic rules of life prior to our incarnation, but once we are here on this Earth plane, we easily forget.We are bombarded by so many distractions and temptations.That we can easily forget our ideas and the reason why we incarnated.We get lost in our ego, materialism and selfishness. So once again we might make new or similar mistake as in the past and then we are even more trapped.In the cycle of reincarnation.But if we live consciously.By the basic root of life, like the golden rule and the Time commandments, we can bring our soul into a higher vibration. That means when we die, our soul will then be attracted to a higher level of existence.Than we were before we incarnated.Eventually, we will no longer need.This liver disease sycle here on Earth and continue our education and our growth of consciousness in the higher realms.Now some of us may wonder why we usually don't remember any of our previous lifetimes.This is purposely hidden from us because we should live in the here and now, and exact knowledge about our former incarnations would only burden us. Think about it. We may have done maybe, if I have hundreds of former life sent many. We have done and done awful things.Now this knowledge alone would over shadow our decisions in carrying out our daily tasks.Once we understand the dynamics of the law of reincarnation, everything falls into place. Suddenly everything makes sense. Why are some poor, others are rich, some healthy, other sick, why there are worse and so on. I have always been amazed by the incredible love and perfection that rules our magnificent.Universe.Literally, this was only a very short overview, and I hope you're inspired to study more on this incredible subject. Did you know that reincarnation was a fundamental part of the original Christian teachings and that it was later banned by a Roman emperor? Come join the in Part 2 of reincarnation and I will tell you more about it.You may also enjoy the videos on Karma and how Karma works. \n"

That means when we die, our soul will then be attracted to a higher level of existence.Than we were before we incarnated.Eventually, we will no longer need.This liver disease sycle here on Earth and continue our education and our growth of consciousness in the higher realms.Now some of us may wonder why we usually don't remember any of our previous lifetimes.This is purposely hidden from us because we should live in the here and now, and exact knowledge about our former incarnations would only burden us. Think about it. We may have done maybe, if I have hundreds of former life sent many. We have done and done awful things.Now this knowledge alone would over shadow our decisions in carrying out our daily tasks.Once we understand the dynamics of the law of reincarnation, everything falls into place. Suddenly everything makes sense. Why are some poor, others are rich, some healthy, other sick, why there are worse and so on. I have always been amazed by the incredible love and perfection that rules our magnificent.Universe.Literally, this was only a very short overview, and I hope you're inspired to study more on this incredible subject. Did you know that reincarnation was a fundamental part of the original Christian teachings and that it was later banned by a Roman emperor? Come join the in Part 2 of reincarnation and I will tell you more about it.You may also enjoy the videos on Karma and how Karma works. \"\n",

      "This is a.Multi parts in one Q&A video.We have received a ton of questions about the creative society, their predictions on an exact doom date, and the things they say are going to happen. I've actually had some e-mail interactions with one of the individuals from the creative society and they do want to chat at some point in the future, but.Since the questions keep coming in and there seems to be a.Anxiety about it. Let me just go ahead and address a couple of things right now.First.The vast majority, there's a bunch of things they use in their model, but the vast majority of the timeline and things like that that they use in their model come from an earthquake record that they got from volcanodiscovery.com.This is what they show.And they basically say that it shows this upward trend that when it continues, based on math and extrapolation, should result in millions and millions of earthquakes per day destabilizing the entire planet in just a couple of years.The problem is that.This is magnitude 3 to magnitude 9, and yes, there's a pretty substantial curve. But the curve goes down if you use magnitude 5 to magnitude 9. It also goes way down to nearly flat if you use magnitude 7 to magnitude nine. And one of the issues is that in the last two decades, especially in the last three decades.They have gotten a lot better at recognizing all those little earthquakes.Um.It's standard knowledge that before about 60 or 70 years ago, they were missing up to half the magnitude 6 earthquakes on the planet.When it comes to the lower magnitude ones, the ones that are harder to see, it really wasn't until the last decade or even last few years when seismometers really were much more widely distributed, especially in other parts of the world not outside of the United States, that they were really able to confidently say yes. Now we're capturing them all. So if you.Just go on. How many are on the record? Yeah, it's going to look like that. They had no way to actually see these ones way back in the past.And so that's a really critical point to be made. It shouldn't take away from the fact that there are several other things that point to the coming years, coming two decades as being a very tumultuous time geophysically on this planet.But in terms of using magnitude 3 to magnitude 9 over the last several decades?It really, in my opinion, offers a skewed perception of reality. I also wouldn't be using the Volcano Discovery Records I would use.A combination of USGS, GEONET, and.The the European service as well which are more complete and so that's #1 #2.Their main thing that they say will happen with the moment of big disruption is when at the bottom of the Marianna trench.The magma breaks through and comes in contact with the ocean and they say when this happens there will be a super huge explosion like you get whenever you pour. You know, melted scalding metal into say a tub of water.The problem is.There are about 50 times more.Volcanic eruptions under the ocean. Then there are up here where we can actually observe them. Magma Baba is constantly, every second of every day, coming in contact with the ocean and it does not produce these effects.Um.Doing this in a tub is very different than actually taking a look at what is happening geophysically. Not to mention the fact that it's not just boiling hot metal in in the mantle, it's other things as well as other chemistries. And so when you combine that with the modern observations and knowledge that the vast majority of the volcanoes are under the ocean.And they are constantly going off, if you wanna ask the question about global optics in this or that.We don't really know because the majority of those are actually not well studied, not well observed. It's hard to have constant observation of something at the bottom of the Pacific on the on the sea floor like that. In the middle Lantic Ridge, there's constantly magma coming up and pushing out on the plates like this.Across thousands and thousands of miles, it doesn't do anything like that.And so that's #2.Uh.#3 relates to that they say when this happens it's going to create this massive eruption and explosion of.Basically millions to billions of times any nuclear blast that has happened on the earth before and that this blast will kill the entire earth.In addition to that not being supported by the things I just mentioned.What we are going through is a cycle. It happens every 12,000 years. Something like that has never happened before.There is nothing that is coming right now in this cycle that didn't happen 12,000 years ago, that didn't happen 24,000 years ago, 36,000 years ago, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And so I would say that for literally all the all the reasons I just mentioned that is highly unlikely.They also claim that when this happens and there's a magnetic disruption, the moon will either be flung into the sun or crash down into the earth.This is not exactly supported by the magnetic science or basic gravity, which yes, we can have the conversation all we want at some other point about gravity being a function of electricity and magnetism. But even still, things can be calculated in terms of gravity by drop something, you can still use gravity to describe it mathematically.Quantity qualitatively, et cetera.Um.And then on top of that, there's the fact that the moon has never been flung into the sun or crashed down into the earth before. And this cycle happens every 12,000 years. And again, nothing is going to happen this cycle that didn't happen 12,000 years ago and 12,000 years before that and 12,000 years before that, just like all those other times. There are a handful.Of the millions and millions of species on this planet, a handful of species that will probably go extinct. There will be a major hit to the population of nearly every species. But nothing like this.Is supported by the evidence and the data.So.I realized that this is very much a video where I'm expressing topics that are opinions on topics that are directly counter to somebody else. I realized that this is in many ways a debunking of what someone else is saying. I do not necessarily wish to express any disrespect, but.I healthily and respectfully disagree with several of the points made, several of the predictions made, and several of the rationale behind those points and predictions. So that's my take on the creative society, and the only other thing I have to say is picking out an exact date.Based on these things seems.Not only wrong to me, but almost scientifically inappropriate. So there's my take on the creative society. Still willing to chat with you guys if you want to talk about some of these things and get your head around the stuff that.Is well documented, is observable and can't be denied. And seem to happen over and over and over again in these past cycles.See you in the morning for The Daily Show.Be safe everyone. \n"

      "We'll start with some basic questions. This guy is in a world where it feels like nothing is as it seems. Blue. It's blue, of course. Coach has blue. Sky is blue. 1 + 1 is 2222. There's at least one truth we thought was indisputable and the earth.Flood, you're the slap. My reality, my senses tell me that the earth is flat and stationary work, so I thought.But for the people attending the first Flat Earth International conference here in Cary, NC, they're Earth is indisputably not round. Yeah, everybody here can agree on absolutely one thing, which is it is not a globe. For centuries of Flat Earth was accepted as certainty until science and sailboats said.Otherwise, they want the rules of power is you never admit that there's someone bigger than yourself. But in 2015, this guy Mark Sargeant posted his Flat Earth clues, part of a series of clues that can help you get your head around both the design of the Flat Earth system we live in. You're kind of the like, father of this.How? How would you? Don't do that, started it all. I did not invent flutter. All I did was walk up to a door.Point at it. Say you know what?I think it's a really interesting things on the other side of this and check it out for yourself.If Flat Earth is a university, you know FBI.Then I would be the freshman recruiter. People have traveled from around. Actually, Mark would say across the flat world to its head. The first World Flag Club is you don't talk about flat club until now. You know, I have a poem about that. It's right here. Amy Nicholson wrote a book of poetry.About her Flat Earth journey. A few months flat and seven months to rally. Kim Gurley came to the conference from Houston. I haven't really come out all the way yet. I'm still a little in the closet, poles in the middle. Weenie in a volley came from even farther. I mixed with quite a lot of flat Earthers and in New Zealand.You know, flatters, I guarantee it. But you don't know who they are because they're afraid of talking about it. Why 2/3?Like many modern movements, this one has grown in large part out of the Internet, with rappers like Odd TV evangelizing to hundreds of thousands of subscribers, no more living on a cartoon ball and YouTube channels like Globe Busters.Encouraging skepticism about what you've been taught.But for the serious students here at the conference, this has gone to a point now where is becoming really, it all comes down to proof. When it comes to science, there's things you can test right now, right? Fire burns, waters, wet drop. Something falls the ground that appears to be gravity. Those are things you can test, right? But the curving horizon, the sloping sea level, the spin of the.Unless you can see these phenomena with your own eyes, they may not be true. A lot of people are going this is this is crazy, right? But think about this. For the last 2025 generations, this is what we've told people, unlike what we've been told in school, some flatter Thurs imagine the earth looks like a snow globe.Round but not sphere. The North Pole is at the center of Most Flat Earth maps, with the ice of Antarctica holding everything in. So are you certain this is what the earth looks like? Pretty sure.I mean, there there are some details to be worked out, sure, but the face of concept is sound. Absolutely sound. And one thing again, we absolutely know for a fact this ain't it. So those iconic blue marble images seen from space Flat Earthers denounced them as fakes. You start seeing words like composite.Or animation. Or, you know, something that tells you this is not an actual photograph of the earth. Yes. Question. So if you think you might have questions, feel free to line up and ask them. While I read the opening statement, the flatEarthers have many many more. This is what returns to Earth, which is why I thought someone who's actually.Seeing the earth from space might have some answers. 1 + 1 is two. What color is the sky?Hello, and the Earth is round second is here this model of it, Professor Mike Massimino spent more than 20 days in space and worked on the Hubble telescope. So when you looked at the planet, what did it look like? Looks round folks. It is round like my eyewitness account.And I looked at it as much as I could. It is round. OK, were in the final countdown. How you doing over there? He's playing himself on The Big Bang theory. But some flat Earthers actually believe astronauts are just actors, part of a huge conspiracy going back to those very first steps on the moon.That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. You don't believe that they've gone to space? No, no, not at all. the Rockets go up. Sure there's nobody in them. Hope you're ready to listen fast, because I'm ready to speak fast. Rob Skiba is another one of the celebrity contrarians in the Flat Earth movement. His popular YouTube videos.Podcasts take clues from the Bibles Book of Genesis. There's no way you can get a spinning heliocentric globe out of anything in the Bible. Are you skeptical of everything? I have become skeptical of everything, and I think rightfully so. Pretty much everyone here, though, is kind of a conspiracy theorist. They don't see that's a commentary, but I think there's a little bit of conspiracy theorists.All of us. I really do. This is gonna be fun. It's why many of them do their own experiments. Darrell Marble packed a level on a flight to test if the plane was flying parallel to a Flat Earth. So there's going to be some sciency people who say that is a real Bobo experience experiment they have.That's a little basic, I know. It's so simple. It'll go right over your head. The credo over many of these believers. Check it out for yourself. Go out and test.You just want them to ask the questions. Why do you believe what you believe and let you go from there?Because I could tell you something that they just look at me sound crazy. A lot of people watching this are gonna be like that man is crazy. I'm sure they probably do. And and I would say, well, they're crazy for not testing what they think they believe. But in a world of disagreements large and small, for something as clear as this horizon, the interpretation.Infinite for Nightline, I'm Eva Pilgrim in Cary, NC.\n",

      "As you all know, the earth is round. However, there are some people who believe that the earth is flat. I am here to talk to you about why the earth is flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason why the earth is flat is because the Bible says so. In Isaiah 40:22 it says, “He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.” This shows that the Bible believes that the earth is flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second reason why the earth is flat is because it is the only way that the Bible's prophecies about the end of the world can come true. For example, in Revelations 20:8 it says, “He will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth. He will gather them together for battle: the Niles and the Euphrates will overflow their banks; and 200 million mounted troops will invade the land from the north.” If the earth were round, then the nations at the four corners of the earth would be impossible to gather together.\n",

      "The third reason why the earth is flat is because it explains why Christopher Columbus was able to sail to India. If the earth were round, then Columbus would have sailed off the edge of the earth.\n",
      "\n",

So this is a story that most, I think, Americans are not even aware of, but.Clearly people within the US government believe it's real or they wouldn't have attached this to a spending bill, correct?Correct. Yes, this is being called the Roswell before Roswell. And you're right, people with some knowledge of these intelligence programs who've been briefing Congress about this made sure that this was put into the legislation. And it's some, it's one of many UFO provisions in the new defense bill.The DoD must provide Congress with a list of everything they've found out about this this specific incident, but all other incidents and programs from January 1st, 1945 onwards and anyone involved in these programs or with information about it will be released from their secrecy oaths and non disclosure agreements.And they'll be able to testify to Congress about this.So here we have the nuclear connection again. This was around the first detonation in in human history of a nuclear device. Subsequent to that you've had UFO sightings that nuclear missile bases around nuclear powered aircraft carriers, nuclear powered submarines. There's a clearly some new I mean I don't pretend to understand, but nuclear has some connection to these sightings, no.That seems to be the case, and again, Congress is demanding answers on this. We had the latest report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence last week that highlighted the fact that there were several hundred more sightings being investigated, military sightings, than we'd heard of.Before talked about unusual flight characteristics and performance parameters of this and yeah, we must get to the bottom of this UFO and nuclear connection.Yeah.
